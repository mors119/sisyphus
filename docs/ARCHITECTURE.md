# Sisyphus Academy

Sisyphus Academy is a self-hosted knowledge capture platform built with Spring Boot, React, a Chrome extension, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker.

The project is designed with a clear separation between reusable platform infrastructure and academy-specific business logic.

# API Architecture

The API application lives in `apps/api`. It uses feature packages rather than a
second, parallel layer tree. Each feature may contain:

- `controller`: HTTP validation, authentication principal extraction, and response mapping
- `service`: use-case orchestration, business rules, and transaction boundaries
- `repository`: persistence queries
- `entity`: JPA persistence and domain state
- `dto`: explicit request and response contracts
- `exception`: expected domain failures

Cross-cutting framework configuration and shared response types live in `global`;
JWT filters and Spring Security adapters live in `security`; external storage,
mail, Redis, and OAuth adapters remain in their owning feature packages.

## Request flow

```text
Security filter
  → Controller (transport only)
  → Service (@Transactional boundary)
  → Repository
  → Entity
  → Service maps Response DTO
  → Controller returns HTTP response
```

Controllers must not access repositories, make business decisions, or return
entities. Request and response DTOs remain separate when their roles differ.
Entity-to-response conversion is completed inside the service transaction so
lazy persistence state does not cross the application boundary.

## Transactions

Write use cases declare `@Transactional` on service methods. Query use cases that
need a persistence context declare `@Transactional(readOnly = true)`. Controllers
and repositories do not define application transaction boundaries. A propagation
override such as `REQUIRES_NEW` must remain visible and be justified by the use case.

## Error handling

Expected failures extend `BaseException` and are translated once by
`GlobalExceptionHandler`. Authentication entry points use the same JSON shape.
Validation failures include every rejected field; internal exceptions and stack
traces are logged server-side and never returned.

```json
{
  "status": 400,
  "code": "VALIDATION_ERROR",
  "message": "email: 올바른 이메일 형식이어야 합니다.",
  "path": "/api/auth/check",
  "timestamp": "2026-07-26T00:00:00Z",
  "fieldErrors": [
    {
      "field": "email",
      "message": "올바른 이메일 형식이어야 합니다."
    }
  ]
}
```

The `status` field is retained for backward compatibility. Domain failures use
stable application codes with empty `fieldErrors`; validation failures use
`VALIDATION_ERROR`. Unexpected failures return `INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR` without
implementation details. Ownership failures that previously surfaced as 500 now
consistently return 403, and missing resources return 404.

## Configuration and logging

Environment-dependent values are bound through `AppProps`, `JwtProps`,
`FileProps`, and `MailProps`. Security owns CORS configuration, while MVC configuration owns static
resources. Refresh-token persistence derives its TTL from `JwtProps`; callers do
not duplicate expiration constants. Application code uses SLF4J and must not log
tokens, passwords, cookies, or complete sensitive payloads.

## Testing boundaries

- unit tests cover service rules and token utilities
- MVC slice tests lock transport and error contracts
- integration tests verify application wiring and persistence

Issue-specific changes add focused regression tests. The broader layered test
matrix is maintained separately so architecture refactoring does not create a
parallel test implementation.

The backend is also divided into two conceptual product layers.

## Platform Layer

Reusable infrastructure that can be adopted by other projects.

### Authentication

- JWT authentication
- Access token management
- Refresh token management

### OAuth

- Google Login
- Naver Login
- Kakao Login

### Email Verification

- Verification code validation
- Redis-based expiration management

### File Management

- File upload
- Image serving
- Storage abstraction

### API Documentation

- OpenAPI
- Swagger UI

### Infrastructure

- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- Flyway
- Docker

# Web Architecture

The web application lives in `apps/web` and follows a feature-oriented structure.

```text
src/
├── app/
├── features/
└── components/
```

Guidelines:

- Business logic belongs to features.
- Routing and application bootstrapping belong to `app/`.
- Shared UI components belong to `components/`.
- Feature modules should avoid direct coupling.

---

# Chrome Extension Architecture

The browser extension lives in `apps/chrome-extension`.

Its code is organized around WXT entrypoints such as:

- `entrypoints/background.ts`
- `entrypoints/popup/`
- `public/`

---

# Infrastructure

## Containers

- web
- api
- postgres
- redis
- nginx

Managed using Docker Compose.

---

# Design Principles

## Separation of Concerns

Platform functionality must remain independent from academy-specific business logic.

## Environment Driven Configuration

No production URL, secret, or environment-specific configuration should be committed.

All runtime configuration must come from environment variables.

## Open Source Friendly

The project should be executable locally with:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

after copying:

```bash
.env.example
→ .env
```

without requiring code modifications.

---

# Future Direction

The long-term goal is to keep Sisyphus Academy as a concrete implementation while extracting reusable platform components where appropriate.

Potential extraction candidates:

- Authentication module
- OAuth integration module
- Email verification module
- File management module
- Docker deployment templates
- CI/CD templates
